# Dominion Companion

## Summary  
This extension allows you to dynamically see what cards are in your Deck, your Discard Pile, as well as what cards are in your opponent's deck, at any given point in the game.

Also, for each card that is in your deck, the extension dynamically provides the probability of drawing it.  You can also see the probability of drawing a card in the next 2, 3, 5, or any number of draws.  

The extension is designed to help you make informed game decisions, have more fun, and win more matches.

Note: Currently supports card pools 1 and 2.
